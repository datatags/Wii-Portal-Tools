# Wii Portal Tools

A Python driver for interacting with the Disney Infinity and Lego Dimensions portals from a PC.

Inspired by a number of other resources:
- Disney Infinity in Python: https://github.com/jfether/di-usb-library
- LEGO Dimensions in Python: https://github.com/woodenphone/lego_dimensions_protocol
- LEGO Dimensions in Node.js: https://github.com/AlinaNova21/node-ld

The main goal for this project is to be able to control the platform lights, and read and write arbitrary NFC tags.
